## Database Setup

```shell
 Create 2 new databases in Mongodb
```

```Mongodb
Create database pdf_user

Create database pdf_record

```

## Project Structure

### Backend 
```shell

##  Logic and Assumptions

1. **When a user asks a question**
     an entry is created in user_asked_question table with following:
    - user_id
    - doubt_id
    - doubt_body

2. **Results are generated**
    from the catalog_questions table and shown to the user as a list and following things are passed as parameters in               generated list's xpath:        
    - user_id
    - doubt_id
    
3. **When user clicks on any video, API is called**
    That API has following components:
    - it accepts user_id, doubt_id from parameters
    - it accepts question JSON
    - then it querries in pdf_user table and checks if the user_id already exists in table or not
    - if user_id exists then it updates doubt_id, question_json, timestamp
    - else it inserts the new entry with user_id, doubt_id, question_json, timestamp
 4. **Now we schedule a cronjob**
    which works every 1 minute and logs in a file for which we do the following:      
    - We take list of entries in pdf_user made between (current time - 5minutes) and (current time - 10 minutes).
    - We get list of user_ids and doubts ids whose entries where made in that time frame.
    - Now we querry again with those user ids in between current time and (current time - 5minutes).
    - Now we get list of user_ids who were active in this time frame.
    - We now, find the corresponding doubt_id with user_id which was not active.
    - Thus, we get doubt_ids which are most recent,inactive since 5 minutes and the user which is too inactive.
    - Now we querry in pdf_user table with those doubts_ids for getting question_json.
    - We first convert those question_json to pdf.
    - Now, We assign an unique name to pdf by uuid, add s3 link to it and upload it to S3 bucket.
    - Now we make an entry in pdf_record table with pdf's s3 link, doubt_id, timestamp.
    
### Users

1. **create users** 
    this will create a new user with a random username

### Posts

1. **create post**
    this will create a new post, required fields are
